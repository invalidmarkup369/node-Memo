## Reflection

  - This was a side project that I made while I was learning about authentication, security and  OAuth
  - This project I mainly build it for myself because I wanted to store all the codes that use on the cloud I didn't want to be in notepad because there are going to be times when I learn something and I wouldn't be on my computer
  - This project was really challenging and it was the best learning experience
  - There were some obstacles but I defeated them quickly
  - Tools that I used in this project were:
    **HTML5**
    **CSS3**
   **JavaScript**
   **Node.js**
   **EJS**
   **Passport.js**
   **Google OAuth**
   **Facebook OAuth**
   **Github OAuth**
